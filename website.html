Interest in IT
<ul>
<li>
My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

I choose to study at Rmit because this university provides students with the most advanced technology for IT learning. In addition, many skillful, talented software engineers graduated from this University, and they all get hired by famous companies such as Google, Microsoft. Therefore, I want to become a member of Rmit where I could prove to everyone what my talent is, and maybe earn some computing reward. At Rmit, I can have the best study environment as well as the kind,helpful teachers. There is nothing to say much about the school facilities because everything is perfect. I like the way teachers in Rmit taught students, if you donâ€™t understand one part of the lecture, the teacher always please reply to your email about parts that you have trouble with.
